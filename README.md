National Park Service - Web Scrape

Python web scrape demonstration that utilizes the Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.

Creates a basic data set by first grabbing parks and their respective information by State. 

Next, each park's coordinates (if available) are pulled from Google search results.

(*Coordinate step currently runs very slow, looks for ways to optimize or other methods for grabbing coordinates.)
